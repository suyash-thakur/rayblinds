            Blinds are a popular and functional window treatment. They are usually controlled by a manual pull cord and
            are composed of individual slats that are formed together, individually.
            They are made of different fabrics and materials and are available in various textures, designs, and
            fashions depending on your choice. An essential feature of blinds is that they can be raised or lowered,
            tilted, and otherwise moved to control light.
